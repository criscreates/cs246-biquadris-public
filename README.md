# Biquadris
A unique spin on the classic Tetris, created for our CS 246 (Object-Oriented Software Development) course. 

It is a two player game inspired by Tetris where players take turns placing blocks on their own screens, trying to clear lines by moving, rotating, and dropping tetrominoes. When a block is placed above the player's board, they lose.

Players have 5 different difficulty options to choose from (Levels 0-4) which affect the types of blocks that are generated, the probability that each type of block is selected, and the manner in which the blocks fall and/or can be moved.
Players can also use "special abilities" to negatively effect the other player's experience and attempt to eliminate them more quickly. They can "blind" a certain portion of the grid, force their opponent's next block to be of a certain type, and also make their opponent's blocks "heavier." 
The game is played and controlled through a console interface.

During development, we leveraged header and implementation files to make our code modular and minimize compilation time when changes were made.
We also utilized the MVC, Observer, Decorator, and Factory object-oriented design patterns to put our classroom knowledge into practice and improve the effficiency & readability of our code.

Below is the UML diagram for our implementation of Biquadris.
